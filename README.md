### Grad-CAM Explainability

To improve transparency and interpretability, the application generates Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) visualizations showing which regions of the chest X-ray contributed most to the model's prediction.

Red and yellow regions indicate stronger influence on the final classification, helping users understand where the model is focusing during inference.

## 🔬 Explainable AI with Grad-CAM
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is used to visualize the regions of a chest X-ray that contributed most to the model's prediction.

The heatmaps below highlight areas that received the highest attention from the VGG16 model during inference. Red and yellow regions indicate stronger influence on the final prediction.

#### Normal X-ray Grad-CAM

#### Pneumonia X-ray Grad-CAM

### Grad-CAM Interpretation

---

Grad-CAM improves model transparency by highlighting image regions that influenced the prediction.

These visualizations help verify whether the model is focusing on clinically relevant thoracic regions rather than unrelated image artifacts.

While Grad-CAM provides insight into model attention, it does not guarantee clinical correctness and should be interpreted as an explanation of model behavior rather than a definitive localization of disease.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

The dataset contains significantly more Pneumonia images than Normal images.

As a result:

* Pneumonia sensitivity is very high
* Some Normal images may be incorrectly classified as Pneumonia

### Future Improvements

* Dataset balancing techniques
* Additional data collection
* Hyperparameter optimization
* Model ensembling
* Cloud deployment

---

### Explainability Notes

Grad-CAM provides a visual explanation of model attention but does not guarantee clinical correctness.

Highlighted regions indicate areas that influenced the model's prediction rather than the exact location of disease.

The system should be considered a decision-support tool and not a substitute for expert radiological interpretation.
